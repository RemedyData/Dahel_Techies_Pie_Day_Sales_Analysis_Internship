***Disclaimer:*** This is not a real company as we know this is a dataset compiled by Dahel Consultant Techies for Internship purposes. 


## Introduction

This is Pie sales performance analysis. It is done by analyzing data from  the Pie Day table which comprises of Order NO	Order Date column, Month/Yr column, Day of Week column, Pie Flavor column, Quantity	column, Cost column, Slice Or Whole Pie column, Pre-Order/In-Store Purchase column, Organic? column. I used Excel to get an overview of the dataset before importing it into Power BI where the actual analysis was carried out. 

## Problem Statement

The goal of this analysis is to know:

- What was the total number of orders?
- The total number of pies produced?
- Which flavor did the customer order most?
- Which means did the customer order for pie the most (pre order or in store purchase)?
- What is the relationship between the cost and quantity.  
- What is the cost per year and month?



## Skills and Concepts Demonstrated:

- Power BI concepts like:
   - Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations
   - Developing general DAX calculations that deal with text and numbers,
   - Performed advanced DAX calculations for solving statistical measures and other mathematical formulas,
   - Data Modelling,
   - Measures,
   - Filters,
   - Tooltips,
   - Page buttons,
   - Data visualization

  ## Data Source:
  
The dataset for the work is gotten from Dahel Consultant Techies. It consists of 2,774 records and 10 fields of data. I studied the dataset well to gain proper insight into the dataset.

## Data Transformation:

**Step 1:**
- After downloading the dataset, I imported it into POWERBI.

**Step 2:**
- It loaded the dataset authomatically in Power Query Editor but there was no cleaning needed because it was already a cleaned data.

**Step 3:**
- For the column cost I assumed it was the cost of production  because I wasn’t sure if It was the selling price or the cost of production 

**Step 4:**
- After checking the columns, it was loaded into POWERBI for visualization.

## Data Analysis and Visualization:

Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired KPI or Metrics.
I arrived at a report with a single dashboard consisting of different visuals such as bar chart, doughnut chart, line chart, slicer, and KPIs, giving the summary of the insights gained into the company's performance.

## Features of the Report:
The dashboard conveys information about the following key areas:
- Total number of orders
- The total number of pies produced
- Flavor with the highest order
- Means of order (pre order or in store purchase)
- Relationship between the cost and quantity 
- The total cost per year and month

## Analysis

Summary of the insights gained into the chess Game performance: 

- A total of 2,773 orders were placed between 1st of June, 2019 – 1st of November 2021.
- A total of 8333 pie was produced during that period. The total cost it took to produce the 8333 pie was $96,922.50
- 51.21% of the pie produced was pre-order while 48.79% of the pie were purchased in store.
- There were over 6 flavors of pie and the Apple flavor had the highest cost of production followed by Strawberry Rhubarb
- About 52.51% of pie ordered where whole pie and 47.49% were sliced.
- The higher the quantity, the higher the cost.


## Recommendation

- Due to the uncertainty whether the cost provided is the selling price or the cost of production much recommendation can't really be given. 
- There’s no way to know which pie flavor generates more profit or the one with the most profit.
- The Apple flavor is the most ordered pie and it should always be made available. 
- The PIE should still be made available as both pre-order and in store purchase because there’s no much difference in how customer choose to purchase their price. 
- Both whole pie and sliced pie should also made available since customers placed other for both and the margin between both isn’t much. About 52.51% of pie ordered where whole pie and 47.49% were sliced.
